Codes for the SIGIR 2022 paper Less is More: Reweighting Important Spectral Graph Features for Recommendation

# Environment
The algorithm is implemented in Python 3.8.5, with the following libraries:<br/>
* Pytorch+GPU==1.8.0<br/>
* Numpy==1.19.2<br/>
* Pandas==1.1.4<br/>

Due to the inefficiency of CPU, we only provide a GPU implementation.
